      <p>Formula 1 and McLaren will enter a new era in the coming years, the former through a raft of sporting and technical regulation changes, the latter through the ending of their long relationship with Mercedes Benz – and moving to Honda power. This seems like a perfect time to re-evaluate the McLaren brand as a whole, progressing the visual language to remain engaging whilst encapsulating their endless desire for technical innovation and perfection.</p>
      <p>My proposal is very much an evolution of the existing brand, pushing its best qualities forward, but injecting the heritage from when Bruce McLaren first joined the Formula 1 community in 1958.</p>
      <p>The examples in this brand specimen are a cross section of areas the visual language can expand into. I see this as an ongoing project that will continue to develop as McLaren continues to innovate and move into new markets.</p>
